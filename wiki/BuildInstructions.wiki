#summary Building the source.
#labels Phase-Implementation

You need visual studio.

Compile the code in src into a static lib. Link to that from the apps in examples. All apps in examples are MFC projects.

In each example, there will be a class inheriting from ASWork (like ASWorkSample, ASWorkFlexRun, etc.). This is the place to start coding in.

To compile the flex part, for each project you have to have the bridge folder with FABridge.as inside it.

More details coming soon.
