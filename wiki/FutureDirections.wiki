#summary Future roadmap for Flex C++ bridge
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Flex C++ Bridge - The Future =

Fake a NPAPI host (firefox's plugin architecture) to load firefox plugin version of flash player. --- This is done, just need to figure out the externalinterface bit in firefox.

This is being done to port the bridge first to Linux. I don't have a MAC, so can't do anything about a mac port.

~~Support communication via sockets. This should make it platform agnostic. Instead of putting XML requests from On Flash Call to Flex Call Queue.~~
